# PythonDashboard
#### Flight Delay Visualization Dashboard! üõ´‚úàÔ∏è  Step into the realm of aviation data with our dynamic dashboard, meticulously crafted using Python's DASH library and adorned with captivating CSS effects. Immerse yourself in a visually enchanting journey through the "flights.csv" file, focusing on flight delay statistics and insights. 

#### This code is a Python script that creates an interactive web-based dashboard using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. The purpose of the dashboard is to visualize and analyze flight delay data. Here's a simplified breakdown of what each part of the code does:

 1. Importing Libraries: The script begins by importing various Python libraries needed for the dashboard, such as Dash (for the web app), Pandas (for data manipulation), Plotly Express (for creating interactive plots), PIL (for working with images), and base64 (for encoding images as strings).

 2. Loading Data: The script reads flight delay data from a CSV file using Pandas. It then processes this data by converting date columns to datetime format and calculating a "total_delay" column by summing up different types of delay columns.

 3. Creating Images: The script opens an image file using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and prepares it to be displayed in the dashboard.

 4. Creating the Dashboard Layout: The dashboard layout is constructed using Dash's HTML and core components. It consists of different tabs, each representing a different type of visualization.

 5. Callback Functions: Dash uses callback functions to update the visualizations dynamically based on user interactions. There are three callback functions defined in the script:

  * Update Line Chart: This callback updates a line chart based on the selected date range, origin, and destination. The chart displays the total delays for flights in the specified criteria.

  * Update Scatter Plot: This callback updates a scatter plot based on the selected delay type (e.g., carrier delay, weather delay). It calculates the correlation between total delay and the selected delay type.

  * Update Interactive Charts: This callback updates scatter plots based on the user's interaction with the first bar chart. When a specific airline is clicked on the first chart, the corresponding scatter plot of departure time versus total delay is shown for that airline.

 6. Running the App: Finally, the script runs the Dash app using the app.run_server() function. It specifies the port number to run the app on.

#### In summary, this script creates a dashboard that allows users to interactively explore flight delay data. They can visualize total delays over time, correlations between different delay types, and the impact of departure time on delays. The dashboard's interface is user-friendly and offers various visualization options to analyze the provided flight delay dataset.
